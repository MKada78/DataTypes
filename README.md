# DataTypes
Python script (function 'MaxLength') to find the length of all the variables contained in a dataframe.
This script will also the variables and recommend wether or not to set them as categorical variables (pandas type 'category').  
The purpose behind this script is to help you to define the right data types and variable length when creating your database. For example, in MySQL, you define these data types and lengths in the 'schema' file.

## Files in my repository:
- Python_Max_Length_V20.py : the script of the function.

### Prerequisites
- Python (I use version 3.7.2)
- An IDE for Python (I use Jupyter Notebook but you can use any other IDE or code editor).

### To run the MaxLength function :
1- Copy and paste the function in your code editor. <br/>
2- Call the function with one argument which is the name of the dataframe you wish to analyse (exp : MaxLength(my_df) <br/>
3- You're done ! A table will be displayed providing you with the information mentioned in the first section of this Readme file.
